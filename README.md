# RevealSurroundings Plugin

omg entities exposed (#public-shaming #public-exhibition #almost-caught)<br>
Reveals entity data around you (omg hot girls 5km around you)

## Basics of this plugin

### Calling

 -> `/reveal` or `/r` or `/show` to call this command

### Usage

 -> `/r [entity type] [radius]` 

	-> sends entity data in in-game chat (bunch of getters)
	
	-> if u use /r all u might get spammed

	-> eg `/r v 10`
		-> `v` => `reveals EntityVehicle type entities`  [required]
		-> `10`   => `radius of entity detection around you`	      [not required, default 500 (alm everything)]

 -> `use at your own risk, may crash game if too many entities near you.`
